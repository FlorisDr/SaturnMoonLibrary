simulation binder:
    need:
    Moon count --DONE
    dit --DONE
    Default parameters
    documentation string needs some work
    adding a few include/not include parameters --DONE
    nice:
    Powershell code plus documentation --(almost DONE)

C++ code:
    need:
    particle-particle colision --SIMON (waarschijnlijk toch niet, geen prioriteit)
    nice:
    Some 4th order integrator that is selectable --DONE
    Other integrators need to fixed -- DONE
    particle moon collision radius may need to be personalized w.r.t. the moon --DONE
    ring falls down: --DONE

SaturnMoonSimulation Module:
    need:
    code to organize the files generated by the simulation --(partially done would rather structure the databases slightly differently)
    add header to binary file with the usefull information --(patrtially done, Nice to do it slightly differently)
    nice:
    Advance the Horizons multiple data path s.t. we can compare our model to their data --(almoste DONE, only need existing data checker, also doens't work for simulation)

Ring Potentials:
    need:
    notebook that makes them --DONE
    nice:
    get a folder set up where the ring files reside and maybe a few other versions of ring potentials --DONE
    Alexanders JULIA ring calculation experiment

Animation and Data Analysis:
    need:
    A read function that reads the header for data structure (DONE but should become a class related object) --DONE
    Make The animation functions a few simple one's, ie clean it up  -- No longer Relevant

    New:

    plottclass file needs a lot of cleaning and splitting.
    Analysis of waves need to become a class, some shit needs to be archived and we need an simple wavelength function thing going on.
    the Bodies class, needs some cleaning
    The bodies class needs a center option.
    Their needs to a claas that looks at the energy conservation of all the integrators
    THeir needs to be a function that looks at the position wrt all the integratros and horizons
    we need to look at the relevance of J2 and The ring potentials
    plot of collisons over time.


    Nice:
    look at the pizza slice shit.

Documentation:
(if everything is done)
    Github page
    Read me's
    documentation strings need some updating
